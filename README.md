# Random Quote

## What is it ?

The Random Quote Project is a small website designed to make use of an API to show a random quote.

This dynamic website holds the following features :

- Darkmode
- A random quote fetched automatically at the start of the page
- Button to fetch another random quote
- Possibility to access the wikipedia page of the quote's author

I used an API to get data and show it to my website users.

## What did I use ?

- HMTL
- SASS / CSS
- JavaScript with async functions


## How can we see it ?

Go check [my github page](https://yourisrachid.github.io/random-quote-using-async-await/)
